# Simple_python_scripts
This repository is to store one time used python scripts, for automation purpose on my day to day usage of PCs.
First script is written to update my files on Mycloud NAS system- file formats; i.e., Updating file names of TV Shows files to the format where Plex can recognise the file names and organize them as TV shows.


_This script I used to update my TV Shows files._

_SQl Script to clean and generate retention of customer._

# Testing is always good.
 - LLM as judge
 - Human in the loop
 - Prepare Unseen data and test with unseen data. [ Semantic Search, Cosine Similarity metrics] - Machine is able to understand

Properietary Data issue has been resolved:
- Using context [Context Engineering]
- Finetuning of the model [Changing weights of the model, ]
- Using Chunked Data [And feeding relevant information to context].

- Metadata filtering [RAG Works]
- HDFC is building chatbot, user has query about vectordb.
- Unstructured to structured.
- Combining reasoning with actions [Agentic AI]
- Any person activity can be converted to Agentic AI.
- Application has to register the tools with LLM, then LLM will decide the tool.
- RAG is independent of LLM and heavily dependent on Embeddings and index Search.
